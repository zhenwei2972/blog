# Journey thus far
### Somehow survived NS, trying to recover from my abysmal math background with help from the great khan 
...As it turns out there are tons of resources to help fill the gaps in knowledge that is part and parcel of a traditional math education. I am aware that a typical Singapore education may not exactly be considered traditional with its rather progressive and evolving teaching methods, yet to state otherwise would be false , for I am a prime example of a student who've fallen through the cracks, yet managed to clamber back up, via the poly route. 
...Math does seem pretty promising and with the practical applications of it in view, I find myself intrigued to understand the mathematics that drive the advances of AI and the various other computing fields.
...well enougly daddling about, back to geometric sequences & progressions? end transmission 18062019
